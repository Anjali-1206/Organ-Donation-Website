				Our prime focus has always been and will always be to serve humanity unconditionally. Our vision is to bridge the gap between the number of people who need organs and the number of people who donate organs. We want to ensure that the maximum number of people pledge their organs for donation.We also aim to make the process of organ transplantation smoother and faster.

			<p>
				The primary goal of organ donation is to save or improve the life of someone who needs a transplant. Organ donation can help people with organ failure or serious medical conditions that have led to organ malfunction or loss. Organ donation can save up to eight lives. A single organ donor can save up to seven lives. A donated kidney can help a patient avoid dialysis, while a donated heart can give someone a new lease on life.
